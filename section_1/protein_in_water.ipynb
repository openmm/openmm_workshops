    "`CheckpointReporter` saves periodic checkpoints of a simulation. The checkpoints will overwrite one another - only the last checkpoint will be saved in the file. Loading a checkpoint will restore a simulation to a reasonably close, but usually not identical, state to when it was written. The checkpoint contains data that is highly specific to the System, Platform, and the hardware and software of the computer it was created on. If you try and load it on a computer with different hardware it is likely to fail. Checkpoints created with different versions of OpenMM are often incompatible. \n",
    "\n",
    "For a more portable way of saving the state of a simulation you can save the checkpoint as an xml state file. Read the [API docs](http://docs.openmm.org/development/api-python/generated/openmm.app.checkpointreporter.CheckpointReporter.html) for more information."
